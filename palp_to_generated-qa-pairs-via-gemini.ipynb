Viridarium (32): Tino, practically intact until the Second World War, during which it was bombed, the S wall, with a red background and black plinth with yellow panel and sphinxes facing either side of a gorgonion, was imagined as preceded by two statues of Nymphs-fountains on small pillars, each supporting a shell-shaped basin, with birds in flight and tambourines suspended from ribbons, broken through by a large arched window through which the scene of Ancona's death could be seen. The narration of the episode takes place in two moments: the young hunter, depicted in the background behind the rocks in the aposkopeìn gesture, he sees Artemis bathing in a rocky ravine (the Partenia source in Gargaphia of the Alexandrian version of the myth) which almost takes on the shape of a niche, in front of which are the hydrìa, symbol of spring waters on one side and the quiver, the spears, the radiated crown and the mantle of the goddess on the other. The latter, in a pose derived from that of Doidalsas' Aphrodite, but with notable modifications in the position of her arms, turns towards Actaeon with a threatening gesture and, having transformed him into a deer \\\"in fact, horns have sprouted on his forehead\\\" against his own dogs who, in this framework, in which the figures of the characters have larger proportions than in other versions of III or of the same IV style to fill the available space, have the characteristics of molossers. to FSC 1405\n",

And in fact there are many uncertainties of the Pompeian copyist especially in the treatment of the anatomy so much of the hero with sagging shoulders, the arms too short and the features of the face coarse and vulgar, as much as the Minotaur that can be glimpsed in the lower left. The mosuo has been conveniently hidden inside a door, so as not to have to face the foreshortening vision and what little you see, especially the arm, is ridiculously short. Errors continue to exist in the anatomy of children who are close to the hero; the faces of the characters of the Cretan group and the young Athenians are devoid of any solemnity, while their arrangement is correct, which evidently derives from a cardboard suitable for measures and proportions to the painting, whose heroic subject remains completely foreign to the Pompeian painter who faced it as if it were \\\"a news story\\\" (Bianchi Bandinelli 1976).\n",

      "Image Description: 13. Triclinium (h), wall N, central mat: picture with the abandonment of Ariadne by Theseus (PI, 1231). The girl wakes up on the beach of Naxos, where she is represented in the company of winged Nemesis, on the left, who shows her the boat of Theseus that moves away, and a cupid that wipes its tears lowering its (useless) bow. In the lower right corner are two personifications that allude to the marine setting of the story. It is interesting to note how the painting, which presents us with the 'escapist' version of the story of Theseus and Ariadne, maintains on the left the figure of Athena emerging from the rocks: the presence of the goddess belongs to the heroic reading of this episode, a favorite reading in the Augustan age, which emphasizes the figure of Theseus who abandons the young woman because he is called to refound Athens. In the House of the Tragic Poet VI 8, 3 - which contains significant points of contact with the decoration of this house - the same iconographic redaction of our triclinium is adopted in a cubicle (cf. vol. IV, p. 563, fig. 72), while the triclinium of the house, decorated in the same phase, adopts the heroic version of the episode: this circumstance also confirms precisely the different meaning of the two iconographic redactions of the same episode to which we have mentioned above (cfr. vol. IV, p. 563, fig. 72 and p. 576, fig. 94; Bragantini 1995, p. 192). It is very likely that from the painting of the triclinium of the House of the tragic poet our painter drew the idea of inserting the figure of Athena in the scene of the awakening of Ariadne, thus implementing a sort of episodic contamination between the two iconographies and the two readings. Another cupid leans out of the rock in the upper left. IV style.\n",

According to NdS, in a room, not yet entirely excavated in 1891, of a small house to the south of the House of the Centenary, a badly conserved painting was found on the west wall. It showed Theseus abandoning Ariadne. It was 1.09m high by 1m wide. The sleeping Ariadne was on the left but was completely destroyed. On the right is a ladder which acts as a bridge resting on the prow of the ship. On the bridge is the naked Theseus giving his right hand to a bearded sailor who helps him climb aboard.

Of the painting we have the description of Helbig (H, 255, no. 1217): Theseus lingers with his left foot on the pier of his boat and looks at Ariadne lying asleep on the shore on shaggy blankets. He raises his left hand as if in a monologue, while with his right hand he stops the reddish cloak lined with blue that covers his left shoulder and back. Its head is adorned with a crown of whitish leaves. Arianna has her hair gathered in a pink retina and places it on double bracelets and is covered, from the hips in gia, by a green cloak lined with purple. In the background is the sea and the walls of a city.\n",
